## Part One: Living in Dubai — the real costs and financial reality

### Housing: understanding the true cost

Housing is the most significant expense. Rental prices are expected to rise approximately **3–5% in 2026 vs 2025**, after stronger growth in 2025. For accurate planning, focus on **total occupancy cost**, not just advertised rent.

**Typical monthly budgets (AED):**
- **Single professional:** AED **10,200–12,000** (1BR rent: 5,000–8,500)
- **Couple:** AED **13,500–16,000** (1–2BR rent: 7,000–14,000)
- **Family:** AED **26,000–32,000** (3BR + schooling; rent: 15,000–25,000)
- **Executive:** AED **40,000–60,000+** (premium residence: 30,000–40,000+)

> **Often-overlooked costs:** housing fee (5% on annual rent via DEWA), agency fee (~5% + VAT), Ejari (~AED 220), security deposit (5–10%). A realistic rule: **add ~25–30%** to advertised rent to estimate true occupancy cost.

### Utilities: the hidden summer shock

DEWA typically averages **AED 500–800** in moderate months but can surge to **AED 1,500–2,500** in summer for a 2BR due to air conditioning. Villas can be **AED 1,500–3,000** monthly.

District cooling (separate in many buildings): **AED 400–1,500/month**. Internet is typically **AED 300–400**; mobile plans **AED 150–300**.

### Transportation and mobility

Public transport passes are typically **AED 140–350** depending on zones. Petrol is relatively affordable; ownership costs include registration, comprehensive insurance (often **AED 1,200–2,500/year**), and maintenance.

## Part Two: Financial benefits and compensation structure

### The tax advantage: 0% personal income tax

A major attraction is **zero personal income tax**, meaning professionals retain a much larger share of earnings versus high-tax jurisdictions.

### Compensation structures

Dubai packages often combine base + bonus tied to AUM, NNM and revenue.

|---|---:|---|
| Junior RM (2–5y) | 27k–44k | 50–100% of base |
| Mid RM (5–10y) | 38k–66k | 100–150% of base |
| Senior RM (10+y) | 66k–88k | Total comp can reach 150k–180k/month |
| Executive Director / Unit Head | 95k–125k | Total 1.5–2.2M/year |
| Market Head / MD | 132k–186k | Total 2.5–3.5M/year |

**Typical allowances:**
- Housing: AED 20k–40k/month (senior)
