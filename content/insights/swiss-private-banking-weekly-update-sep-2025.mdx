## Highlights

- Strong onshore CH demand; MEA & Portugal diaspora remain active from Geneva.
- Discretionary + recurring advisory revenue viewed most favourably for onboarding.
- Banks continue to prioritise **clean compliance history** and **documented AUM portability** over pure headline AUM.

## What we’re seeing in Geneva & Zurich

Hiring managers across Tier 1 Swiss platforms remain focused on:

- **Portable, multi-year books** with stable recurring revenue.
- Clear **booking-centre breakdown** (CH onshore vs offshore, Monaco, Luxembourg, Dubai, Singapore).
- Documented **UHNW / HNW segmentation** and pipeline visibility for the next 12–24 months.

Relationship Managers who can articulate a **credible 18–24 month business plan** (by market, booking centre and product mix) are progressing fastest through interview processes.

## Portability & client behaviour

- MEA and Portugal diaspora books remain **highly portable** from Geneva when:
  - KYC files are clean and up-to-date.
  - Clients are already multibanked or open to platform diversification.
- For CH onshore, portability is more selective, with banks stress-testing:
  - Level of institutional loyalty.
  - Depth of team coverage (investment specialists, lending, wealth planners).
  - Pricing, credit and platform advantages at the target bank.

## Practical next step
